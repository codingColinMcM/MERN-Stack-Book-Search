# MERN-Stack-Book-Search

## Description

A full stack web application based on the MERN stack that enables the user to search for books. An Apollo Server is set up and uses queries and mutations from GraphQL to
fetch and modify the book data. Authentication middleware that is supported by the GraphQL API is also used to login and signup verified users. An Apollo Provider is 
also utilized so that requests can be made to an Apollo Server. This application is deployed using Heroku.
